[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://manzt.github.io/anywidget-chi-hni-demo)

This repo contains a demo of **anywidget** for the [2024 ACM CHI Workshop on
Human-Notebook Interactions](https://humannotebookinteractions.github.io/).

You can watch the [video](https://youtu.be/Uzm9_2ZBfxo) and follow along in the
JupyterLite notebook, or just run the cells on your own. To learn more, check
